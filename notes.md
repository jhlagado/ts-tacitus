maybe allow identifiers to start with numbers? that would require pushback
literal arrays
ranges
interned strings / symbols
tuples / vectors ????
sequences / iterators
maps / reduce / scan - map is a unary case of scan
< and > may be used as special syntax
{ } for code blocks
[ ] for literal arrays
syntax needed for n-fork

a fork might be represented using parenthese ( ) or < >
a quoted primtive e.g. `+ might be shorthand for {+} 
i.e. `+/ as opposed to {+}/
