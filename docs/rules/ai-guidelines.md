# AI Development Guidelines for TACIT

## Core Principles

### Specification-First Development

- **Never modify `specs/` files** unless explicitly instructed
- **Always consult relevant specs** before implementing features
- **Validate against specifications** before considering implementation complete
- **Reference specs in commit messages** and code comments

### TACIT Language Conventions

- **Stack effect notation**: Use `( before ‚Äî after )` format consistently
- **Left-to-right evaluation**: All operations process arguments in order
- **Immutable data structures**: No in-place modification of lists or capsules
- **Type safety**: Preserve tagged value semantics across all operations

### Code Quality Standards

- **Follow existing patterns**: Match style and structure of current codebase
- **Comprehensive testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and error cases
- **Clear documentation**: Explain stack effects, constraints, and edge cases
- **Performance awareness**: Consider memory usage and execution efficiency

### Pseudocode Style Rule

- Use only C-style, structured pseudocode (loops, conditionals; no functional style)
- Do not use associative arrays/maps or assume a heap; model arrays as contiguous indexed buffers
- Avoid recursion where iterative forms suffice
- Write pseudocode that can be implemented directly in low-level languages (C/assembly)

### Numeric Convention Rule

- Default to IEEE-754 float32 for all numeric values in examples and pseudocode
- Do not use integers unless explicitly instructed to do so
- When literals are shown, treat them as float32; only use integer tagging/fields when referring to existing VM tags/specs

## Implementation Rules

<!-- BEGIN OPERATIONAL SAFEGUARDS (APPROVED) -->
## Operational Safeguards (AI Change Control)

MANDATORY rules governing any AI-proposed modification. Violation = reject change.

1. No Unapproved Modifications
	- AI MUST NOT edit code, tests, or docs without prior explicit user APPROVE.
	- Specs (`docs/specs/`) especially immutable unless user explicitly requests.

2. Proposal Requirement (before any edit)
	Proposal message MUST contain:
	- Problem Statement (what & where)
	- Risk If Unchanged
	- Minimal Change Scope (files, conceptual line ranges)
	- Alternatives (including Do Nothing)
	- Test Impact (new / modified / none)
	- Revert Plan (single step)

3. Approval Protocol
	- Only proceed after user replies with APPROVE (case-insensitive, standalone or clearly indicating approval).
	- Any other reply => NOT APPROVED. AI must revise or abandon.

4. Allowed Pre-Approval Actions
	- Read-only analysis: search, diff, listing, summarizing.
	- Absolutely no patch application or file creation.

5. Commit Messaging (when edits approved & performed externally)
	- Header: `[APPROVED] <summary>`
	- Body: Reference proposal label, list modified files, confirm tests passed.

6. Revert Guarantee
	- Every proposal includes exact revert instruction (e.g., remove block, restore file from commit SHA).

7. Emergency Stop
	- If user sends `STOP` alone, AI enters read-only mode until user says `RESUME`.

8. Read-Only Mode
	- If user says `READ-ONLY MODE`, AI ceases proposals & edits; resumes only after `EXIT READ-ONLY MODE`.

9. Drift Check
	- Before applying an approved patch, AI re-validates target content (diff/hash mental comparison). If drift -> issue DRIFT WARNING and re-propose.

10. Tag Conventions in Chat
	- PROPOSAL ‚Äì Introduces change (no edits yet)
	- APPROVE ‚Äì User authorizes
	- REVISE ‚Äì User requests modification; AI reissues
	- ABANDON ‚Äì User cancels pending proposal
	- DRIFT WARNING ‚Äì Detected content divergence before apply

11. Metrics (Optional, Encouraged)
	- Report test suite counts before/after (should be unchanged unless adding tests explicitly approved).

12. Scope Minimization
	- Proposal must justify why each file is touched; unrelated refactors forbidden.

13. Spec Integrity
	- Any spec change needs separate explicit approval even if part of a larger approved change.

14. Single Logical Change Rule
	- Do not batch unrelated edits under one approval.

### Stack Operations

- **Always validate stack depth** before popping operands
- **Use `vm.ensureStackSize(n, operation)`** for safety checks
- **Preserve stack integrity** across all operations
- **Handle empty stack gracefully** with appropriate error messages

### Memory Management

- **Respect segment boundaries** in VM memory layout
- **Use tagged values consistently** for type safety
- **Avoid memory leaks** in string and list operations
- **Test memory edge cases** like overflow and underflow

### Testing Requirements

- **Test the happy path** with expected inputs and outputs
- **Test error conditions** with invalid inputs and edge cases
- **Test integration** between different VM components
- **Use `resetVM()` consistently** in test setup to ensure clean state
- **Always run full test suite** after completing each implementation step
- **MANDATORY: Run tests at the end of every step** to catch regressions early
- **Use yarn for all package management** and test execution commands

## Architectural Constraints

### VM Design

- **64KB total memory** with fixed segment layout
- **32-bit tagged values** using NaN-boxing technique
- **Stack-based execution** with postfix notation
- **Direct bytecode addressing** without function table indirection

### Symbol System

- **Built-ins use opcodes 0-127** with `Tag.BUILTIN`
- **Colon definitions use bytecode addresses** with `Tag.CODE`
- **Symbol table provides direct addressing** for unified dispatch
- **@ prefix creates code references** without execution

### List Format

- **Reverse layout**: header `LIST:n` at TOS with `n` payload slots beneath
- **Traversal by span**: element boundaries discovered via simple-or-header span rule
- **No LINK tag**: legacy backlink mechanism removed; any docs referencing it are historical
- **Flat serialization**: contiguous slots, no heap pointers

## Development Workflow

### Plan Processing

1. **Read the complete plan** including all steps and context
2. **Identify the active step** marked with üéØ **ACTIVE**
3. **Understand step dependencies** and requirements from specification
4. **Implement the current step incrementally** with testing
5. **Mark step complete** and identify next step when finished
6. **Follow mandatory stop protocol** - get user approval before proceeding

### Multi-Step Plan Management

- **Keep related steps together** in numbered plan files
- **Maintain step sequence context** for complex implementations
- **Move entire plans to done/** when all steps complete
- **Reference step numbers** in commits and documentation

### Error Handling

- **Provide clear error messages** with context and stack state
- **Use appropriate error types** (StackUnderflow, TypeError, etc.)
- **Test error conditions thoroughly**
- **Maintain VM consistency** even after errors

### Code Review Checklist

- [ ] Implementation matches specification requirements
- [ ] All edge cases have test coverage
- [ ] Stack effects documented and correct
- [ ] Memory usage is appropriate
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

## Communication Guidelines

### Code Comments

- **Explain stack effects** for all operations
- **Document constraints** and assumptions
- **Reference relevant specifications** for complex logic
- **Include examples** for non-obvious behavior

### Commit Messages

- **Reference spec files** that guided implementation
- **Explain what changed** and why
- **Note any constraints** or limitations
- **Include test status** (passing/failing)

### Documentation Updates

- **Keep specs synchronized** with implementation
- **Update test cases** when behavior changes
- **Maintain glossary** with new terms
- **Document performance characteristics**

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Implementation Anti-Patterns

- ‚ùå **Modifying specs** without explicit instruction
- ‚ùå **Breaking stack effect contracts** without updating documentation
- ‚ùå **Ignoring memory constraints** in VM design
- ‚ùå **Creating new VM instances** in tests (use global `vm`)

### Testing Anti-Patterns

- ‚ùå **Testing implementation details** instead of behavior
- ‚ùå **Forgetting `resetVM()` in test setup**
- ‚ùå **Not testing error conditions**
- ‚ùå **Hardcoding magic numbers** instead of using constants

### Design Anti-Patterns

- ‚ùå **Heap allocation** for temporary data structures
- ‚ùå **Mutable data structures** that break functional semantics
- ‚ùå **Deep recursion** that could overflow call stack
- ‚ùå **String manipulation** without proper segment management
