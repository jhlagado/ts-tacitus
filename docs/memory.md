# Memory Management in Tacit

## Overview

The `memory.ts` file in the Tacit codebase is responsible for managing the memory layout and providing low-level memory operations. It defines the structure of the memory space, including sections for the stack, return stack, strings, heap, and code. This file is crucial for the efficient management of memory within the constraints of a 64KB memory space.

## Key Features

### Memory Layout

- **Memory Size**: The total memory size is 64KB (65536 bytes).
- **Sections**: The memory is divided into several sections, each serving a specific purpose:
  - **STACK**: The main stack for data manipulation.
  - **RSTACK**: The return stack for storing return addresses.
  - **STRINGS**: A section for storing string data.
  - **HEAP**: The heap for dynamic memory allocation.
  - **CODE**: The section for executable code.

### Memory Operations

- **Read and Write Operations**: The `Memory` class provides methods for reading and writing 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit values from memory. These methods ensure that all memory accesses are within the valid range.
- **Float32 Operations**: Special methods for reading and writing 32-bit floating-point numbers, which are the primary data type in Tacit.
- **Tagged Pointers**: Methods for reading and writing tagged pointers, which are used to store metadata along with data.

### Error Handling

- **Range Checks**: All memory access methods perform range checks to ensure that the accessed memory addresses are within the valid range. If an access is out of bounds, a `RangeError` is thrown.
- **Debugging Support**: The `dump` method provides a way to inspect the contents of memory for debugging purposes. It returns a hexadecimal representation of the memory contents within a specified range.

## Detailed Components

### Memory Class

- **Constructor**: Initializes the memory buffer and data view.
- **Read and Write Methods**:
  - `write8(address: number, value: number)`: Writes an 8-bit value to the specified address.
  - `read8(address: number)`: Reads an 8-bit value from the specified address.
  - `write16(address: number, value: number)`: Writes a 16-bit value to the specified address.
  - `read16(address: number)`: Reads a 16-bit value from the specified address.
  - `writeFloat(address: number, value: number)`: Writes a 32-bit floating-point value to the specified address.
  - `readFloat(address: number)`: Reads a 32-bit floating-point value from the specified address.
  - `writeAddress(address: number, value: number)`: Writes a tagged pointer (tagged as `CODE`) to the specified address.
  - `readAddress(address: number)`: Reads a tagged pointer (tagged as `CODE`) from the specified address.
  - `writeInteger(address: number, value: number)`: Writes a tagged pointer (tagged as `INTEGER`) to the specified address.
  - `readInteger(address: number)`: Reads a tagged pointer (tagged as `INTEGER`) from the specified address.

### Debugging Support

- **dump(start: number, end: number)**: Returns a hexadecimal representation of the memory contents within the specified range. This method is useful for debugging and inspecting the state of memory.
- **dumpChars(start: number, end: number)**: Returns a string representation of the memory contents within the specified range. This method is useful for debugging and inspecting string data.

### Design Decisions

1. **Fixed Memory Size**:

   - The total memory size is fixed at 64KB, which is suitable for restrictive systems. This constraint ensures that the memory management system is simple and efficient.

2. **Memory Sections**:

   - Dividing the memory into sections for the stack, return stack, strings, heap, and code simplifies memory management and ensures that each section serves a specific purpose.

3. **Range Checks**:

   - Performing range checks on all memory accesses ensures that the system does not access invalid memory addresses, preventing crashes and ensuring robustness.

4. **Tagged Pointers**:

   - Using tagged pointers allows for storing metadata along with data, which is essential for the efficient management of memory and data structures in Tacit.

5. **Debugging Support**:
   - Providing methods for dumping the contents of memory is crucial for debugging and inspecting the state of the system. This ensures that developers can easily diagnose and fix issues.

## Conclusion

The `memory.ts` file is a critical component of the Tacit programming language, providing low-level memory management within the constraints of a 64KB memory space. Its design decisions, such as fixed memory size, memory sections, range checks, tagged pointers, and debugging support, are tailored to the needs of a restrictive system, ensuring efficient memory use and robustness.
