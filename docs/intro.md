# Comprehensive Overview of the Tacit Virtual Machine Codebase

This document provides an in-depth summary of the Tacit VM codebase, outlining its architecture, core components, and key functionalities. The Tacit VM is designed for a stack-based, reverse Polish notation (RPN) programming language inspired by array-oriented languages like APL and J. It operates within a 64KB memory space using 16-bit pointers and emphasizes efficiency, immutability, and structural sharing.

## Architecture Overview

### Key Design Principles

1. **Resource-Constrained Efficiency**: Optimized for low memory usage with fixed-size blocks and deterministic reference counting.
2. **Immutability & Structural Sharing**: Arrays use copy-on-write semantics, cloning only modified blocks to preserve data integrity.
3. **No Garbage Collection**: Relies on reference counting (`BLOCK_REFS`) to manage object lifetimes explicitly.
4. **Stack-Based Execution**: Uses two stacks (data and return) without stack frames, similar to Forth or PostScript.
5. **Persistent Data Structures**: Inspired by Clojure, arrays are immutable with shared structure for unmodified segments.

## File Structure and Responsibilities

### 1. Memory Management (`memory.ts`, `heap.ts`, `tagged-value.ts`)

- **`memory.ts`**:
  - Manages the 64KB memory buffer as a `Uint8Array`.
  - Provides low-level read/write operations for 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit floats.
  - Implements memory safety checks (RangeError on invalid access).

- **`heap.ts`**:
  - Implements a free list allocator with 64-byte blocks linked via `BLOCK_NEXT`.
  - Supports multi-block allocations for large data structures (e.g., arrays).
  - Uses reference counting to track active references and automate memory reclamation.

- **`tagged-value.ts`**:
  - Encodes 3-bit tags (e.g., `INTEGER`, `CODE`) and 20-bit pointers into 32-bit floats using NaN payloads.
  - Provides `toTaggedValue()` and `fromTaggedValue()` for encoding/decoding.
  - Enables type-safe access to memory-mapped data (e.g., vectors, arrays).

---

### 2. Data Structures (`vector.ts`, `array.ts`, `view.ts`)

- **`vector.ts`**:
  - Manages dynamic 1D arrays (vectors) with automatic resizing.
  - Uses linked blocks to store elements, supporting copy-on-write updates.
  - Provides `vectorCreate()`, `vectorGet()`, and `vectorUpdate()` for manipulation.

- **`array.ts`**:
  - Implements multi-dimensional arrays using vectors and views.
  - Supports shape/stride metadata for efficient element access.
  - Uses `arrayCreate()`, `arrayGet()`, and `arrayUpdate()` with bounds checking.

- **`view.ts`**:
  - Creates views into vectors/arrays for slicing and reshaping.
  - Implements `viewCreate()` to generate typed views with custom shapes/strides.

---

### 3. Execution Engine (`vm.ts`, `compiler.ts`, `interpreter.ts`)

- **`vm.ts`**:
  - Core virtual machine class managing execution, stacks, and memory.
  - Tracks instruction pointer (`IP`), data stack (`SP`), and return stack (`RP`).
  - Provides `push()`, `pop()`, `rpush()`, and `rpop()` for stack operations.

- **`compiler.ts`**:
  - Compiles Tacit source code into bytecode using RPN instructions.
  - Supports literal numbers, built-in words, and control flow (e.g., `call`, `eval`).
  - Uses `compile8()`, `compile16()`, and `compileFloat()` for bytecode generation.

- **`interpreter.ts`**:
  - Executes bytecode by decoding opcodes (e.g., `Op.Plus`, `Op.Call`).
  - Integrates with the compiler and memory system for seamless execution.
  - Handles errors with detailed stack state reporting.

---

### 4. Language Features (`lexer.ts`, `parser.ts`, `repl.ts`)

- **`lexer.ts`**:
  - Tokenizes input into numbers, words, and special characters (e.g., `{`, `}`).
  - Skips comments (`//`) and handles multi-character numbers (e.g., `3.14`).

- **`parser.ts`**:
  - Translates tokens into executable bytecode using the compiler.
  - Supports colon definitions (`: name ... ;`) and nested blocks (`{ ... }`).
  - Validates operands and throws errors for unknown words.

- **`repl.ts`**:
  - Implements the Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) for interactive execution.
  - Handles user input, executes commands, and displays results/errors.

---

### 5. Built-in Operations (`ops/builtins.ts`)

- Defines all built-in words (e.g., `+`, `-`, `dup`, `drop`) as `Verb` functions.
- Includes arithmetic (`plusOp`, `multiplyOp`), stack (`dupOp`, `swapOp`), and control flow (`callOp`, `evalOp`).
- Uses the `executeOp()` dispatcher to map opcodes to their implementations.

---

### 6. Sequence Processing (`seq/processor.ts`, `seq/source.ts`, `seq/sink.ts`)

- **`seq/processor.ts`**:
  - Implements sequence processors (`seqMap`, `seqFilter`) for lazy transformations.
  - Uses processor blocks to store metadata (source sequence, type, predicate).

- **`seq/source.ts`**:
  - Creates sequences from ranges (`seqFromRange`) or views (`seqFromView`).
  - Manages sequence state (current index, total elements, step size).

- **`seq/sink.ts`**:
  - Provides utilities for consuming sequences (`seqReduce`, `seqRealize`, `seqForEach`).
  - Supports converting sequences to arrays or applying side-effecting operations.

---

## Technical Highlights

### 1. Memory Management

- **Fixed-Size Blocks**: All allocations use 64-byte blocks, eliminating fragmentation.
- **Reference Counting**: Blocks are freed automatically when their reference count (`BLOCK_REFS`) reaches zero.
- **Copy-on-Write**: Updates clone only the modified block, preserving shared structure.

### 2. Data Representation

- **Tagged Values**: Uses NaN floats to encode 3-bit tags (e.g., `INTEGER`, `CODE`) and 20-bit pointers.
- **Vectors/Arrays**: Implemented as linked blocks with metadata (length, shape, strides).

### 3. Execution Model

- **Bytecode Interpreter**: Executes instructions using a simple loop and opcode dispatch.
- **Stack-Based RPN**: Operates on two stacks (data and return) without stack frames.
- **No Local Variables**: State is explicitly managed on the stack or via global dictionaries.

## Future Considerations

- **Porting to C/Assembly**: Simplified design facilitates conversion to lower-level languages.
- **Performance Optimization**: Further streamline memory operations and reduce overhead.
- **Additional Data Types**: Extend support for strings, custom objects, or higher-dimensional arrays.

This codebase provides a robust foundation for a high-performance VM targeting embedded or constrained systems while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.
