The language’s **parser** is a relatively simple component that takes a stream of tokens (produced by the lexer) and compiles them into bytecode for execution. Specifically, the parser function (`parse`) does the following:

1. **Reset the Compile State**  
   - Before processing tokens, the parser calls `vm.compiler.reset()`, setting the **compile pointer** to the beginning or to the preserved area, depending on whether `preserve` was active.  
   - It also clears any state about current “colon definitions” (the `: word … ;` syntax).

2. **Processing Tokens**  
   - The parser loops through each token in order.  
   - If it encounters a **number** (float or integer), it emits an `Op.LiteralNumber` opcode followed by the numeric value.  
   - If it sees **known words** (e.g. `+`, `dup`, or user-defined ones), it looks them up in the dictionary and compiles the corresponding opcode or call. If a word isn’t found, it raises an error, “Unknown word: XXX.”  
   - If it reads a **colon definition** (`:`) token, it starts a new word definition by generating a branch instruction and linking it to the dictionary. The definition ends on a matching `;`, which emits an `Op.Exit` and back‐patches the jump offset.  
   - If it finds a **code block** token (`{`), it treats that as a mini “anonymous function.” It compiles instructions to jump into a separate block of code (`Op.BranchCall`), sets a placeholder for its offset, and increases `nestingScore`. A closing brace (`}`) emits `Op.Exit` and finalizes the jump target.

3. **Error Checking**  
   - The parser forbids “nested definitions,” meaning you cannot start `: word` inside another `:` definition.  
   - It also disallows definitions inside code blocks (`{ :word … ; }` is invalid).  
   - If a definition is not closed (missing `;`), the parser throws “Unclosed definition for NAME.”  
   - If there’s a mismatched `}`, it throws “Unexpected '}'.”

4. **Final Instruction**  
   - After processing all tokens, the parser emits `Op.Abort` to mark the end.  
   - This ensures that any attempt to run code beyond the parsed region safely stops.

5. **Colon Definitions & Dictionary**  
   - A colon definition (`: name … ;`) is registered in the dictionary (via `dictionary.defineCall`).  
   - Subsequent references to that word compile a call into the newly defined bytecode block.

These steps enable a straightforward postfix grammar where numbers, words, and code blocks are recognized and turned into bytecode instructions in a single pass, with minimal overhead. Together with the lexer, this parser allows code like:

```
: square dup * ;
5 square  ( => 25 )
```

to be translated into opcodes stored in the VM’s memory, ready for execution.
