# View Management in Tacit

## Overview

The `view.ts` file in the Tacit codebase is responsible for managing views, which are a way to access subsets of data within vectors or other views. Views provide a flexible and efficient way to work with multi-dimensional data by allowing operations on specific portions of data without copying it. This file handles the creation, access, and updating of views, including support for multi-dimensional views and structural sharing.

## Key Features

### View Block Layout

- **VIEW_VECTOR**: Offset for the pointer to the underlying vector or view (2 bytes).
- **VIEW_DIM**: Offset for the number of dimensions of the view (2 bytes).
- **VIEW_OFFSET**: Offset for the base offset into the vector or view (2 bytes).
- **VIEW_SPEC**: Start of shape and stride data for each dimension.
- **VIEW_SHAPE**: Offset within each 4-byte group for shape data.
- **VIEW_STRIDES**: Offset within each 4-byte group for stride data.
- **MAX_DIMENSIONS_VIEW**: Maximum number of dimensions a view can support, based on the block size.

### View Creation

- **Function**: `viewCreate`
- **Description**: Creates a view over a base pointer, which can be a vector or another view. The view is defined by an offset and a shape that specifies the dimensions.
- **Error Handling**: Returns `UNDEF` if the base pointer is invalid, the shape is empty, or the dimensions exceed the maximum allowed.

### View Access

- **Function**: `viewGet`
- **Description**: Retrieves an element from a view given an array of indices. It calculates the effective offset by adding the view's base offset and the contributions from each index using the view's strides.
- **Error Handling**: Returns `UNDEF` if the indices are out of bounds or if the view pointer is invalid.

### View Update

- **Function**: `viewUpdate`
- **Description**: Updates an element in a view at specified indices with a new value. It calculates the effective offset similarly to `viewGet` and delegates the update to `vectorUpdate`.
- **Error Handling**: Returns `UNDEF` if the indices are out of bounds or if the view pointer is invalid.

### Multi-Dimensional Views

- **Stride Calculation**: Strides are calculated in row-major order, where the stride for dimension `i` is the product of the shapes of dimensions `i+1` to `n-1`.
- **Shape and Stride Storage**: The shape and stride for each dimension are stored in the view block, allowing for efficient access to multi-dimensional data.

### Structural Sharing

- **Copy-on-Write**: Views support structural sharing, where updates to a view may require cloning only the affected blocks, preserving the rest of the structure.
- **Efficient Memory Use**: By sharing the structure of unmodified blocks, views allow for efficient memory use and prevent unnecessary copying.

## Design Decisions

### Flexible Data Access

- Views provide a flexible way to access subsets of data within vectors or other views, allowing for efficient manipulation of multi-dimensional data.
- This design decision is crucial for array programming languages like Tacit, where operations on subsets of data are common.

### Multi-Dimensional Support

- Supporting multi-dimensional views allows for complex data manipulations, such as working with matrices and higher-dimensional arrays.
- The row-major order stride calculation ensures that data access is efficient and intuitive.

### Structural Sharing

- Structural sharing allows views to share the structure of unmodified blocks, reducing memory usage and preventing unnecessary copying.
- This approach is inspired by persistent data structures and is essential for maintaining immutability and efficient memory use.

### Error Handling

- Functions return `UNDEF` in case of errors, allowing for graceful error handling in the language. This ensures that the system can handle errors without crashing, which is crucial for robustness.

## Conclusion

The `view.ts` file is a critical component of the Tacit programming language, providing efficient management of views for accessing subsets of data within vectors or other views. Its design decisions, such as flexible data access, multi-dimensional support, structural sharing, and error handling, are tailored to the needs of a restrictive system, ensuring efficient memory use and robustness.
