# Spec-Driven Development Demonstration

## Example Session: Working with a Multi-Step Plan

This shows how to use the spec-driven structure for numbered plans and AI-assisted development.

### 1. Read the Plan Definition

```bash
cat tasks/todo/plan-01-unified-code-reference-system.md
```

**Result**: Complete understanding of:

- Plan overview: Unified @symbol reference system
- Current status: Step 8/17 active
- Step 8 goal: Create function table bypass mechanism
- Dependencies: VM architecture, tagged values specs
- Success criteria: Direct bytecode addressing

### 2. Locate Active Step Details

Within the plan file, find the ðŸŽ¯ **ACTIVE** step:

```markdown
## Step 08: ðŸŽ¯ **ACTIVE** - Create function table bypass mechanism

- Add `getFunctionTableBypass(functionIndex: number): number | undefined`
- Maps function indices directly to bytecode addresses
- Use existing function table as source of truth initially
- Test that bypass returns correct addresses
```

### 2. Review Dependency Specifications

```bash
cat specs/vm-architecture.md
cat specs/tagged.md
```

**Result**: Understanding of:

- 64KB segmented memory layout
- Function index encoding (â‰¥128 for user words)
- Tagged value constraints and addressing limits

### 3. Apply Development Guidelines

```bash
cat rules/ai-guidelines.md
```

**Result**: Following established patterns for:

- Code quality and testing standards
- Tacit language conventions
- VM design constraints and anti-patterns

### 4. Consult Reference Materials

```bash
cat reference/glossary.md        # Terminology
cat reference/test-cases.md      # Example patterns
```

**Result**: Shared vocabulary and testing approaches

### 5. Implement Current Step with Confidence

With complete context from the numbered plan and specifications:

- Current step requirements are clear and unambiguous
- Previous steps provide foundation and context
- Constraints are well-defined and documented
- Testing patterns are established from prior steps
- Next steps are visible for planning ahead

## Benefits Demonstrated

### For Multi-Step Development

- **Sequential context**: Each step builds on previous work
- **Plan coherence**: Related work stays together in one document
- **Progress tracking**: Clear visibility of completion status
- **Dependency management**: Steps reference each other and specs

### For AI Development

- **Complete plan context**: All steps visible for better understanding
- **Clear current focus**: Active step clearly marked
- **Progress awareness**: Understanding of what's been completed
- **Future visibility**: Can plan implementation considering upcoming steps

### For Human Developers

- **Onboarding efficiency**: New developers can quickly understand system
- **Decision transparency**: Rationale documented in specifications
- **Quality consistency**: Guidelines ensure uniform implementation
- **Knowledge preservation**: Nothing lost when people leave

### For Project Maintenance

- **Authoritative documentation**: Specs are single source of truth
- **Change impact analysis**: Dependencies clearly tracked
- **Regression prevention**: Comprehensive test requirements
- **Architectural coherence**: All changes follow same principles

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (Traditional Approach)

```
README.md                    # Basic project description
src/                        # Code without clear specifications
.github/instructions/       # Scattered documentation
```

**Problems**:

- Documentation and code often out of sync
- Requirements scattered across multiple files
- No clear task organization
- AI assistants lack complete context

### After (Spec-Driven Approach)

```
specs/                      # Authoritative feature specifications
tasks/todo/                 # Discrete, well-defined work units
reference/                  # Shared knowledge and examples
rules/                      # Consistent development guidelines
```

**Benefits**:

- Documentation drives development
- Requirements centralized and authoritative
- Clear task-based workflow
- AI assistants have complete context

## Real Example: Function Table Bypass

The current task demonstrates the workflow:

1. **Specification**: `specs/vm-architecture.md` defines memory layout and addressing
2. **Task Definition**: `tasks/todo/function-table-bypass.md` provides complete requirements
3. **Guidelines**: `rules/ai-guidelines.md` ensures consistent implementation
4. **Reference**: `reference/glossary.md` provides shared terminology

**Result**: AI can implement the feature with complete understanding of requirements, constraints, and success criteria.

## Scalability

This structure scales from:

- **Single features** (individual specs and tasks)
- **Module-level development** (related specs and task sequences)
- **System-wide architecture** (cross-cutting specs and coordination tasks)
- **Multi-team projects** (shared reference materials and guidelines)

## Adoption Path

For existing projects:

1. **Start small**: Create one spec for current development area
2. **Add task structure**: Convert current work into discrete tasks
3. **Establish guidelines**: Document development patterns and constraints
4. **Build reference**: Create glossary and examples as you go
5. **Migrate gradually**: Move existing documentation into structured format

The ts-tacitus project now serves as a complete example of this approach in action.
