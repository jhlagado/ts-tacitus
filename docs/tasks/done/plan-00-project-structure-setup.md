# Plan 00: Project Structure Setup

## Plan Overview
Establish foundational project structure with TypeScript configuration, testing framework, and basic build pipeline for TACIT language development.

## Status: ✅ **COMPLETED** (Moved to done 2024-12-19)

---

## Step 01: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Initialize TypeScript project
- Set up `package.json` with dependencies
- Configure `tsconfig.json` for strict TypeScript compilation
- Add basic npm scripts for build and development
- **Result**: Working TypeScript environment

## Step 02: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Configure Jest testing framework
- Install Jest with TypeScript support
- Set up `jest.config.js` with coverage reporting
- Create test utilities and helpers
- **Result**: Test infrastructure ready

## Step 03: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Set up ESLint and formatting
- Configure ESLint with TypeScript rules
- Add Prettier for code formatting
- Set up pre-commit hooks
- **Result**: Code quality tools active

## Step 04: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Create basic project structure
- Organize `src/` directory with core modules
- Set up `core/`, `lang/`, `ops/`, `stack/` folders
- Create initial module exports
- **Result**: Clean modular architecture

## Step 05: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Add development scripts
- Create debugging and testing utilities
- Set up coverage reporting
- Add documentation generation
- **Result**: Developer workflow complete

## Dependencies
None (foundational setup)

## Success Criteria
- [x] TypeScript compilation working
- [x] Jest tests running with coverage
- [x] ESLint enforcing code quality
- [x] Modular project structure
- [x] Developer scripts functional

## Technical Notes
- Used strict TypeScript settings for maximum safety
- Jest configured for both unit and integration testing
- ESLint rules chosen for functional programming style
- Module structure supports both library and CLI usage

## Completion Summary
All project infrastructure successfully established. Foundation ready for TACIT language implementation with robust development workflow including testing, linting, and automated quality checks.

## Lessons Learned
- Strict TypeScript configuration caught many potential issues early
- Comprehensive test utilities investment paid off in later development
- Modular structure made feature development much cleaner
- Coverage reporting helped identify untested edge cases
