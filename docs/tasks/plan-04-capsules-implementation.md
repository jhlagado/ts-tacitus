# TACIT Capsules Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the step-by-step implementation of TACIT capsules, breaking down a complex feature into manageable prerequisites and phases.

## Terminology Decision

## Prerequisites Assessment

### Already Implemented âœ…
- [x] Lists with LINK navigation
- [x] Maplists with key-value lookup
- [x] Symbol table and `@symbol` references
- [x] Basic method dispatch via `eval`
- [x] Stack manipulation operations

### Needs Implementation ðŸ”§

#### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. **Receiver Register/Context**
   - VM register to hold current receiver object
   - Context saving/restoration for nested calls
   - Integration with existing VM state

2. **Manual Capsule Construction**
   - Functions to build capsule lists manually
   - Validation of capsule structure
   - Basic field access by index

3. **Basic Method Dispatch**
   - `dispatch` builtin: `( receiver method-symbol â€” ... )`
   - Maplist lookup in element 0
   - Error handling for missing methods

#### Phase 2: Field System
4. **Field Access Primitives**
   - `getFieldOp <offset>` builtin: `( â€” value )` reads from receiver register
   - `setFieldOp <offset>` builtin: `( new-value â€” )` writes to receiver register
   - Bounds checking and error handling
   - **To be resolved**: Is offset an element index or slot index?

5. **Receiver Context Operations**
   - `set-receiver` builtin: `( receiver â€” )` sets current receiver
   - `get-receiver` builtin: `( â€” receiver )` gets current receiver
   - `with-receiver` builtin: `( receiver quotation â€” )` scoped execution

#### Phase 3: Syntax Support  
6. **`.method` Sigil Implementation**
   - Tokenizer support for `.method` syntax
   - Parser integration
   - Compilation to receiver dispatch

7. **`with` Combinator**
   - Block syntax parsing `{ ... }`
   - Receiver context management
   - Nested context support

#### Phase 4: Definition Syntax
8. **Field Declaration System**
   - `field` builtin for declaring fields
   - Offset tracking during compilation
   - Symbol resolution for field names

9. **`capsule/end` Definition**
   - Dictionary marker management
   - Phase-based compilation (collect â†’ compile â†’ assemble)
   - Prototype construction

#### Phase 5: Advanced Features
10. **Default Method Support**
    - Integration with maplist `default` key convention
    - Fallback dispatch mechanism

11. **Integration Testing**
    - Full capsule definition and usage
    - Nested dispatch scenarios
    - Performance validation

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

#### Step 1.1: Receiver Register
```typescript
// In vm.ts
interface VMState {
  // ... existing fields
  receiver: TaggedValue | null;  // Current receiver object
  receiverStack: TaggedValue[];  // For nested contexts
}
```

#### Step 1.2: Manual Construction Functions
```tacit
: make-capsule ( method-maplist field1 field2 ... fieldN n â€” capsule )
  # Create list with n+1 elements (maplist + n fields)
  # Validate maplist structure
  # Return properly structured capsule
;

: capsule-valid? ( capsule â€” boolean )
  # Check element 0 is maplist
  # Verify even number of maplist entries
  # Validate structure integrity
;
```

#### Step 1.3: Basic Method Dispatch
```tacit
: dispatch ( receiver method-symbol â€” ... )
  # Extract maplist from receiver element 0
  # Look up method-symbol in maplist
  # If found: set receiver context and eval code reference
  # If not found: check for 'default method or error
  # Restore previous receiver context
;
```

### Phase 2: Field System

#### Step 2.1: Field Access Primitives
```tacit
getFieldOp <offset>     # ( â€” value ) Get field from receiver register
setFieldOp <offset>     # ( new-value â€” ) Set field in receiver register
```

**Implementation details**:
- `<offset>` is an immediate operand following the opcode
- Receiver comes from VM register, not stack
- Validate receiver is capsule before field access
- Check offset bounds (must be >= 1, element 0 is dispatch maplist)
- Handle out-of-bounds with NIL for gets
- Preserve list structure for sets
```

#### Step 2.2: Receiver Context Operations
```tacit
: set-receiver ( receiver â€” )
  # Save current receiver to receiver stack
  # Set new receiver as active
;

: get-receiver ( â€” receiver )
  # Return current active receiver
  # Error if no receiver set
;

: with-receiver ( receiver quotation â€” )
  # Save current receiver
  # Set new receiver
  # Execute quotation
  # Restore previous receiver
;
```

### Phase 3: Syntax Support

#### Step 3.1: `.method` Sigil
- Modify tokenizer to recognize `.method` patterns
- Create `DOT_METHOD` token type
- Compile to: `get-receiver swap 'method dispatch`

#### Step 3.2: `with` Combinator
- Parse `with { ... }` syntax
- Compile to: `set-receiver [quotation] with-receiver`
- Handle nested blocks correctly

### Phase 4: Definition Syntax

#### Step 4.1: Field Declaration
```tacit
: field ( value name â€” )
  # In compilation mode only
  # Store value temporarily in compilation context
  # Record field name with next available offset
  # Increment field counter
;
```

#### Step 4.2: Capsule Definition
```tacit
: capsule ( name â€” )
  # Mark dictionary position
  # Enter capsule compilation mode
  # Initialize field counter at 1 (skip element 0)
  # Set compilation context
;

: end ( â€” capsule )
  # Walk dictionary from marker
  # Collect field declarations â†’ values list
  # Collect method definitions â†’ maplist
  # Assemble capsule: ( maplist ...fields )
  # Install in dictionary as single definition
  # Exit compilation mode
;
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing by Phase
1. **Phase 1**: Manual capsule construction and basic dispatch
2. **Phase 2**: Field access and receiver context management  
3. **Phase 3**: Syntax parsing and sigil compilation
4. **Phase 4**: Full definition syntax and compilation
5. **Phase 5**: Advanced features and edge cases

### Integration Testing
- Nested `with` blocks
- Inter-method calls within capsules
- Capsule field mutation and structure preservation
- Integration with existing list/maplist operations
- Performance benchmarks

## Migration Considerations

### Terminology Updates
- Update all specifications to use "receiver" instead of "self"
- Update glossary and documentation
- Ensure consistent terminology across codebase

### Backward Compatibility
- New features should not break existing list/maplist functionality
- Capsules should be fully compatible with list operations
- Field access should integrate with future variable systems

### Performance Targets
- Method dispatch: O(n/2) where n is number of methods
- Field access: O(1) with compile-time offsets
- Context switching: Minimal overhead (register operations)

## Dependencies and Risks

### Critical Dependencies
1. **Stable list/maplist infrastructure** - foundation must be solid
2. **Symbol table integration** - method names as symbols
3. **VM register management** - receiver context handling
4. **Parser extensibility** - new syntax support

### Technical Risks
1. **Compilation complexity** - multi-phase capsule assembly
2. **Context management** - nested receiver handling
3. **Memory efficiency** - avoiding unnecessary copying
4. **Integration complexity** - syntax and semantic interaction

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental development** - each phase independently testable
2. **Comprehensive testing** - unit tests for each component
3. **Performance monitoring** - benchmark each phase
4. **Documentation** - clear specifications for each feature

## Success Criteria

### Phase Completion Criteria
