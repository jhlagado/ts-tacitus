# Chapter 2 – Getting Started

This chapter guides you through setting up a Tacit development
environment and running your first programs. Tacit is implemented in
TypeScript and the repository provides a REPL and test suite for
experimenting with the language.

## 2.1 Installation and Setup

Tacit’s source code lives in a Node.js repository. To install the
required dependencies and build the project you need a recent
version of Node.js (the repository uses `yarn` for package
management). Clone the repository and run:

```bash
$ yarn install
